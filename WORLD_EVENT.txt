ALL CORRECT CODE IS FOUND IN CLAY FROELICH'S GIT REPO

1. 	To trigger the event, click anywhere on the world.

2. 	A demon will spawn on the tile where mouse was clicked, as long as there is no entity occupying that tile.
	Also, that tile's background will become a pentagram, along with all surrounding tiles.
	If a miner is standing on one of the affected 9 tiles, it will become a dark miner.
	If an oreblob is standing on one of the affected 9 tiles, it will burst into flame.

3.	Miners, when affected, become dark miners. They now ignore ore and blacksmiths, instead targeting full miners.
	When a dark miner gets to a full miner, it turns the full miner into a dark miner.

	Oreblobs' sprites don't change, but they now have added functionality.
	If there are no more veins to attack, oreblobs attack dark miners in "kamikaze" fashion by launching
	themselves at dark miners and exploding into a ball of flame.

4.	The new entity is a demon. It seeks to cause chaos initially and destroy everything eventually.
	It turns non-full miners into dark miners. When there are no more non-full miners, it hunts oreblobs.
	When a demon touches an oreblob, the oreblob turns into a ball of flame. Demons hunt dark miners last.
	When a demon touches a dark miner, it explodes into a ball of flame. 
	Demons never kill each other.

	The idea is that the game ends when demons are the only survivors.

5.	Clay Froelich altered existing behavior and added new classes and functionality to the code.
	Simon Gelber made all images for the project.
